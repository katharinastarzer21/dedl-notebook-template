## How to contribute your own notebook?

Contributions are automated via **GitHub Issues**. Just follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/katharinastarzer21/dedl-notebook-template/issues).
2. Create a new issue using the `Add Cookbook` issue template.
3. Provide the following information:
   - **Repository URL**: Public GitHub repository link of your notebook.
   *Your repository should be forked from this [template repository](https://github.com/katharinastarzer21/template_dedl_repository) to ensure compatibility.*
   - **Title**: A short title for your contribution.
   - **Short description**: 1-2 sentences about what your notebook demonstrates.
   - **Thumbnail image URL**: (Optional) A small image (e.g. PNG) to show on the gallery card.
   - **Root Path Name**: Folder name under which your content will be published (e.g., `my-climate-notebook`).

Once submitted, the following happens automatically:

- âœ… Your repository is cloned.
- âœ… The content is converted into a Sphinx documentation site.
- âœ… The notebook is deployed to GitHub Pages.
- âœ… A preview link is added to the GitHub issue.
- âœ… Once approved and the issue is closed, your notebook goes live on the main site!
